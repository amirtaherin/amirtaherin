### 👨‍🔬 About Me

I'm a senior PhD student exploring the intersection of **efficient AI systems** and **Inference at the edge**. My current work focuses on optimizing the performance of AI models on embedded platforms like NVIDIA Jetson Orin, blending systems-level performance tuning with real-world AI applications.

When I’m not deep in code or running profiling scripts, I enjoy structuring chaos into organized systems—whether in research, task planning, or collaborative workflows.
